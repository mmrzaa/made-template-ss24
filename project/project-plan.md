## Title

Analyzing the Impact of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on Global Temperature Changes

## Main Question

How have methane (CH4) emissions from various sectors and regions contributed to global temperature changes over the past few decades, and what insights can be derived to inform climate change mitigation strategies?

## Description

Climate change is a pressing global issue, and understanding the relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and temperature changes is crucial for developing effective mitigation strategies. This project aims to analyze the impact of methane (CH4) emissions from various sectors and regions on global temperature trends. By combining data on greenhouse gas emissions and global temperature records, we can investigate the correlation between these factors and identify potential drivers of climate change. The results of this analysis can provide valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and the public, helping to inform decision-making processes and guide efforts to reduce emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change.

## Datasources

### Datasource1: Greenhouse Gas Emissions Data

- Metadata URL: https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/api/dissemination/sdmx/2.1/data/env_air_gge?format=SDMX-CSV&compressed=false
- Data Type: CSV

This dataset provides information on greenhouse gas emissions, including methane (CH4), from various sectors and regions across Europe. It covers the period from 1985 to 2022 and can be used to analyze trends and identify major contributors to emissions.

### Datasource2: Global Temperature Data

- Metadata URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/goyaladi/climate-insights-dataset
- Data Type: CSV

This dataset contains global temperature records and other climate-related variables. It can be used in conjunction with the greenhouse gas emissions data to explore the relationship between emissions and temperature changes over time.
